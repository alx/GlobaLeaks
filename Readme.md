# What is GlobaLeaks?
GlobaLeaks is the first Open Source Whistleblowing Framework. 
It empowers anyone to easily setup and maintain their own Whistleblowing 
platform. It is also a collection of what are the best practices for people 
receiveiving and submitting material. GlobaLeaks works in all environments: 
media, activism, corporations, public agencies.

# How to hack on it
You need to get a copy of web2py from 
here: http://www.web2py.com/

and install it (that means get the necessary
gluons into $PYTHON_PATH)

We are currently thinking of moving from launchpad to
github. This is the link to the launchpad page: https://launchpad.net/globaleaks
