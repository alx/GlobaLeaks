# EXPERIMENTAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
# Speed up communication by looking for a Tor-Circuit (PATH) that connect before 3 seconds (low delay circuit)
# If it's not able to open-up a socket within 3 seconds (HIGH SPEED!), retry 5 times improving the chance to get a FAST PATH.
# socket-timeout 3

# Use an existing established hidden-service connection for different inbound connections 
# connection-sharing 1
# Keep connections open for 120 seconds (whether other clients need to use it)
#keep-alive-timeout 120
